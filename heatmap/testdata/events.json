Westbrook: A sincere bottom-of-our-hearts thanks for making this happen! You rock!)\n\nBut the Alaska Airlines-sponsored fete isn\u2019t all that\u2019s going on this Friday night.\n\nAlmost as if it was fate (and who am I to say it\u2019s not?) the Laughing Squid crew is in Portland this week, and they plan to join us at Beer and Blog for a spell.\n\nWhat is Laughing Squid? It\u2019s an online resource for art, culture and technology that also provides web hosting services. The Squiddies are having their own party \u2014 a PDX Drinkup \u2014 this Friday at 7pm at the Lucky Labrador Brew Pub, just down the street from the Green Dragon.\n\nCoincidence? Or FATE? ;)\n\nSo, after we\u2019ve exhausted our wonderful Beer and Blog server Lexie, we\u2019ll trek a couple of blocks down to the Lucky Labrador Brew Pub to meet the the Laughing Squid team at their PDX Drinkup.\n\nI hope to see you at Beer and Blog and later on at the PDX Drinkup.

Using 'Voice of the Customer' processes to develop products that meet REAL market needs.\"\n\nA major component of business success is developing products that meet customer needs and provide superior value. Meeting customer needs requires that those needs be understood. The \"voice of the customer\" (VOC) is the term to describe the stated and unstated customer needs or requirements. The voice of the customer can be captured in a variety of ways: direct discussion or interviews, surveys, focus groups, customer specifications, observation, warranty data, field reports, etc.\n\nThis program will explore the practical side of collecting and using the VOC. Frank Binnendyk, and expert in VOC and a founder partner of Customer Alignment Consulting will explain the basics of this market research methodology. Then, three representatives from companies that have used the VOC research will provide a users' perspective. They will explain why and how they did it; how they used the information gathered; if it worked well or didn't meet their expectations and what were their VOC lessons learned. Ed de la Fuente VP of Marketing from Aperion Audio, John Williams Product Marketing Manager from FEI and Robert Buxton a High Tech B2B Professional will present company examples. The contrast between these types of companies will provide insights into how a VOC program can be scaled and adapted to meet the needs and resources of any company.\n \nAfter presentations by the panelists, members of the audience can express opinions and ask questions of the panel during the Q&A session.\n\nEvent Details \nThursday, January 21, 2010\n5:30 - 6:00 pm Registration and Networking\n6:00 - 7:30 pm Presentations and Q&A\n\nPortland State Business Accelerator Building\n2828 Southwest Corbett Avenue\nPortland, OR 97201\n(503) 725-2312\n\n$20 on-line registration prior to the event.\n$25 at the door\n\nRegister now at www.pdma.org/oregon\n\nFor more detailed information, contact:\nJohn Huber VP of Programs, PDMA Oregon Chapter\n(503) 706-8350\njphuber@ieee.org\n\nPress announcement released by Steve Gerts, VP Communications, PDMA Oregon Chapter\n","venue":{"updated_at":"2008-03-20T10:14:49-07:00","postal_code":"97201","latitude":45.502735,"title":"Portland State Business Accelerator","region":"OR","url":"http://www.psba.pdx.edu/","duplicate_of_id":null,"country":"US","id":202390009,"version":null,"street_address":"2828 SW Corbett Ave","description":"The <a href=\"http://www.psba.pdx.edu/\">Portland State Business Accelerator</a> is a business incubator and accelerator for high technology start-ups.

These are implemented using a two-level model, with threads scheduled across a set of OS-level threads. Since the lightweight threads can\u2019t afford to block when performing I/O operations, when a Haskell program starts, it runs an I/O manager thread whose job is to notify other threads when they can safely perform I/O.\n\nThe I/O manager manages its file descriptors using the select system call. While select performs well for a small number of file descriptors, it doesn\u2019t scale to a large number of concurrent clients, making GHC less attractive for use in large-scale server development.\n\nThis talk will describe a new, more scalable I/O manager that\u2019s currently under development and that hopefully will replace the current I/O manager in a future release of GHC.\n\nDetails:\nDate: January 29th, 2010, Friday\nTime: 1:30pm\nLocation: Galois Inc.,  \ufeff421 SW 6th Ave. Suite 300 (3rd floor of the Commonwealth building)\n\nBio: Johan Tibell is a Software Engineer at Google Inc.

Knock-off products, often from companies outside the United States, eat into sales.  But defending your intellectual property is not inexpensive.   Three of Portland\u2019s leading companies will tell you how they defend their domestic and foreign markets quickly, efficiently, and inexpensively, and how to make these strategies work on any scale. \n\nWhat will you learn?\n - How to diversify your IP portfolio to put your company in the best position to defend your markets \n - How to use the laws of foreign jurisdictions to stop infringing products where they are manufactured \n - How to use the fastest, most cost-effective IP enforcement actions available \n\nPanelists:\n - Tom Evans, Corporate Patent Attorney at Mentor Graphics will relate lessons from Mentor\u2019s patent infringement lawsuit in China and describe how Mentor uses its IP portfolio to defend its markets around the world.\n\n - Julianne Davis, Assistant General Counsel/Intellectual Property at Nike, Inc. will tell you why you should add design patents, trademark registrations, and copyright registrations to your IP portfolios, and how Nike uses its diverse portfolio to police its markets in the US and around the world.\n\n - John Motley, Associate General Counsel & Director of Intellectual Property at Columbia Sportswear, will talk about Columbia\u2019s successful use of Thai and other foreign patent and trademark law to combat infringement where products are manufactured.\n\n - Tigran Guledjian, a partner at Quinn Emanuel in Los Angeles, practices extensively in complex intellectual property litigation with an emphasis in high technology patent litigation.  Tigran will discuss his efforts on behalf of Seiko Epson and other clients to use the International Trade Commission to obtain and use exclusion orders to stop infringing products at the border.\n\nModerator:\n - Brenna Legaard is a partner at Chernoff Vilhauer McClung & Stenzel, an intellectual property law firm in Portland, Oregon. A seasoned trial lawyer, Brenna brings significant real-world experience to her patent prosecution and opinion practice and routinely helps start ups and publicly traded clients alike prioritize their IP budgets and cost-effectively enforce their rights against infringers.\n\nEvent Details:\nWhen:  Wednesday, February 10, 2010\nTime:  7:30 a.m. \u2013 10:00 a.m.\nWhere:  Oregon Zoo, Skyline Banquet Room, Portland, OR\nCost:  Discounted Rate (available to new registrants) $50 TechAmerica members and LES Industry members, $110 nonmember technology companies\nCLE Credits Pending Approval","venue":{"updated_at":"2009-11-04T10:39:31-08:00","postal_code":"97221-9704","latitude":45.510272,"title":"Oregon Zoo, Skyline Banquet Room","region":"OR ","url":"http://www.oregonzoo.org","duplicate_of_id":null,"country":"US","id":202391819,"version":null,"street_address":"4001 SW Canyon Rd.","description":"","locality":"Portland ","telephone":"503-226-1561","longitude":-122.715697,"source_id":null,"address":"","email":"","created_at":"2009-10-28T17:12:21-07:00"},"source_id":null,"start_time":"2010-02-10T07:30:00-08:00","end_time":"2010-02-10T10:00:00-08:00","created_at":"2009-12-21T16:05:22-08:00"},{"updated_at":"2010-01-27T15:49:33-08:00","title":"SAOpdx: The Cultural and Technological Drivers of Innovation at Google","rrule":null,"venue_id":202390607,"url":"http://www.acteva.com/booking.cfm?bevaID=196290","duplicate_of_id":null,"id":1250458239,"version":null,"description":"Presented by the SAO\u2019s CIO/IT Manager\u2019s Forum, ISACA, ISSA, and SIM\n\nGoogle has a reputation for rapid innovation, and is considered one of the most innovative and collaborative corporate cultures in the world.

As more people work from home or work while they are traveling or are in the midst of a rapid startup cycle, they find that they can be more effective and more productive by gathering together to work. Starting with projects like the Hat Factory in San Francisco, co-working sites have bloomed. There are several co-working facilities in the Nortwest, some which are expanding to multiple cities and some that focus on specific audiences or markets. The February SAO meeting will be a panel discussion by three Oregon co-working entrepreneurs: Jeff Jimmerson from Madison Avenue Collective in Corvallis, Josh Friedman from Ned Space in Portland and Rick Turoczy from Portland Innovation Experiment.\n\nJeff Jimerson, founder of the Madison Ave. Collective (http://www.madcollective.com/)\n\nMadison Ave. Collective (the MAC) is a shared office and studio space located in downtown Corvallis, 72 steps west of Starbucks on the corner of 5th street and\u2014you guessed it\u2014Madison Ave. After three months of heavy remodeling, Jeff opened the space on 08/08/08 with a \"nice people wanted\" Craigslist ad.\n\nToday, twelve creative and tech professionals call the MAC home for their respective small businesses.\n\nRick Turoczy, founder of Silicon Florist (http://siliconflorist.com/)\n\nRick Turoczy has been working in high-tech marketing communications jobs in the Portland area for the past 15 years. Out of pure dumb luck, he happened to sit up in bed at 2 AM one night in August 2007 with the inspiration to start Silicon Florist, a blog about Portland startups in the Web, Mobile, and Open Source scenes.\n\nSince then, he\u2019s chatted with The Oregonian a bunch of times, appeared on local television and radio, made a brief appearance on the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, garnered bylines in The New York Times, spoken at numerous events, been selected as a runner up for the Portland Business Journal\u2019s \u201c40 under 40,\u201d launched a startup incubator with the help of Wieden+Kennedy, and co-produced a groundbreaking Web-based telethon called 30 hour day.\n\nAll because of a blog. Weird.\n\nJosh Friedman, co-founder of NedSpace (http://www.nedspace.com/)\n\nJosh Friedman is the co-founder of NedSpace, a provider of co-working facilities for entrepreneurs and startups. NedSpace is designed to be the place where entrepreneurs go to build and grow their businesses. Along with his business partner Mark Grimes, NedSpace has itself grown quickly into two locations from its launch in early 2009. The goal is to open 10 more locations throughout the US in 2010, and eventually to have a NedSpace in every city with a startup ecosystem.\n\nJosh serves on the Board of Starve Ups, a Portland-based entrepreneurial organization and the Oregon Entrepreneurs Forum Advisory Board. He holds a B.S. degree in speech communication from Oregon State University. Aside from helping entrepreneurs grow their companies, you might find him rock climbing, skiing, cycling, brewing beer or generally causing trouble along with his dog Ace.","venue":{"updated_at":"2008-10-01T10:57:38-07:00","postal_code":"97333","latitude":44.559994,"title":"Renaissance on the Riverfront","region":"Oregon","url":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"country":"US","id":202390727,"version":null,"street_address":"136 SW Washington Ave.","description":null,"locality":"Corvallis","telephone":null,"longitude":-123.261238,"source_id":996333253,"address":null,"email":null,"created_at":"2008-10-01T10:57:38-07:00"},"source_id":null,"start_time":"2010-02-11T17:30:00-08:00","end_time":"2010-02-11T20:30:00-08:00","created_at":"2010-02-01T22:35:15-08:00"},{"updated_at":"2010-02-03T20:11:29-08:00","title":"Portland Ten Skill Development Workshop 5: PR with Stephenson","rrule":null,"venue_id":202391600,"url":"","duplicate_of_id":null,"id":1250458277,"version":null,"description":"Join Portland Ten as we explore the changing public relations needs for start ups. \n\nSchedule & Topics\n\nWorkshops are held January 28- April 16,2010, on Tuesdays 2-4 pm and Thursdays 6-8 pm at NedSpace Old Town\u2013 a full schedule of workshops & topics will be released January 26th at http://www.portlandten.com/skills.\n\nPricing\n\n\nPasses can be purchased at the door-- cash or check at the door only, please.

We are going Agile!\u201d Yep, I read an Agile project management book on a long flight to India, and like all good reactionary development managers I was sold!   A few years later our adaptation of the Scrum framework has taken shape, but it was not without strain on our development, test, and other Q/A processes. This session focuses on a retrospective of what went right and more importantly what went wrong as we evolved to our new development process and the effect it had on our team. Perhaps it will convince you that the shift to Agile is the way to go, and hopefully give you just a little more info on what you may be in for.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nRay Arell is a Senior Engineering Manager and Agilist at Intel.

The addition of Microformats to a Web site's markup can further the exchange of semantic information such as contact information for people and events. For the most part, however, web sites and applications are still populated by largely non-semantic prose organized in large blocks of HTML or generated from the walled gardens of relational databases and data warehouses.\n\nWhile everyone agrees that HTML isn't going away anytime soon, several Web Standards have arisen over the last few years to help application developers store, serve, and distribute information with ever-increasing levels of semantics and meaning. The current pinnacle of the Semantic Web Standards pyramid is OWL - the W3C's Web Ontology Language. In this talk I will describe the roots and basics of OWL and how it can be used to power the next generation of smart, data-enabled Web applications.\n\n----------\n\nSpeaker: Brian Panulla\n\nBrian is a technology consultant and developer for Dealerpeak - the Portland-based Web-enabled CRM for automotive dealers.

We will go over process integration, monitoring, engagement, community management, customer support, online reputation management internal communications, project management and legal considerations.\n\nMeasurement and Growth: The final portion of the session will focus on how to properly measure success. This discussion will focus on lining up measurement with your program's specific objectives, choosing the correct tools and metrics for the job, properly reporting successes and failures, and how to use data to ensure the growth of your program.\n\nWho should attend:\nDepartment managers wishing to learn how to effectively build, grow and manage Social Media programs for their business units.\nSocial Media managers and directors wishing to learn how to more effectively manage and grow sustainable Social Media programs for their clients and/or their own firms.\n\nAccount-level agency and digital program managers looking to significantly improve their working knowledge of effective Social Media program management.\n\nCommunity managers, IT managers, HR managers, small business owners (less than 10 employees), marketing project managers, product managers, customer service managers, and anyone not at the Executive level wishing to further their practical understanding of Social Media program management.","venue":{"updated_at":"2008-09-14T20:51:17-07:00","postal_code":"97204","latitude":45.518088,"title":"Webtrends","region":"OR","url":"http://www.webtrends.com/","duplicate_of_id":null,"country":"US","id":202390594,"version":null,"street_address":"851 SW 6th Ave.","description":"","locality":"Portland","telephone":"877-932-8736","longitude":-122.679722,"source_id":null,"address":"","email":"","created_at":"2008-09-14T20:49:19-07:00"},"source_id":null,"start_time":"2010-03-12T08:00:00-08:00","end_time":"2010-03-12T13:00:00-08:00","created_at":"2010-02-18T09:47:55-08:00"},{"updated_at":"2010-03-11T10:43:48-08:00","title":"Open Source Bridge Work Sprint","rrule":null,"venue_id":202391950,"url":"http://opensourcebridge.org","duplicate_of_id":null,"id":1250458431,"version":null,"description":"Come help with volunteer tasks for Open Source Bridge, likely including technical work, outreach activities, and ...?\n\nThis week: \n\nPlease join us Saturday, March 13, 2010 beginning at 11:00 am for a Volunteer Work Sprint.\n\nStuff we'll work on:\n\n* Contacting User Groups, potential speakers\n* Formulating blog posts for posting audio content\n* Strategizing around sponsorships\n* Programming improvements for OpenConferenceWare\n* Creative ways of using $100 worth of Adwords\n\nPlease join us!","venue":{"updated_at":"2010-02-25T11:34:03-08:00","postal_code":"97201","latitude":45.514493,"title":"Market Street Pub","region":"OR","url":"","duplicate_of_id":null,"country":"US","id":202391950,"version":null,"street_address":"1526 S.W. 10th","description":"","locality":"Portland","telephone":"","longitude":-122.6850806,"source_id":null,"address":"1526 S.W. 10th, Portland OR","email":"","created_at":"2010-02-25T11:32:14-08:00"},"source_id":null,"start_time":"2010-03-13T11:00:00-08:00","end_time":"2010-03-13T16:00:00-08:00","created_at":"2010-03-11T09:05:33-08:00"},{"updated_at":"2010-03-05T12:17:10-08:00","title":"Zday 2010","rrule":null,"venue_id":202390088,"url":"http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=359794777068","duplicate_of_id":null,"id":1250458392,"version":null,"description":"Zday is the annual international celebration in observance of the ideas of Jacque Fresco\u2019s Venus Project as presented in Peter Joseph\u2019s popular documentary film Zeitgeist: Addendum.\n\nThe ideas behind Jacque's Resource-Based Economy have become viral and are challenging established paradigms.\n\nWe will be screening a special edit of Zeitgeist & Venus Project videos, as well as hosted discussions.

This talk provides an introduction to the two libraries and the programming style they engender -- as well as a brief look at the formal semantics underlying the libraries.","venue":{"updated_at":"2008-07-11T16:12:44-07:00","postal_code":"97204","latitude":45.520379,"title":"Galois, Inc","region":"OR","url":"","duplicate_of_id":null,"country":"US","id":202390439,"version":null,"street_address":"421 SW 6th Ave. Suite 300","description":"3rd floor of the Commonwealth Building","locality":"Portland","telephone":"","longitude":-122.677897,"source_id":null,"address":"","email":"","created_at":"2008-07-11T16:12:04-07:00"},"source_id":null,"start_time":"2010-03-15T10:30:00-07:00","end_time":"2010-03-15T11:30:00-07:00","created_at":"2010-03-10T16:30:27-08:00"},{"updated_at":"2010-03-10T21:19:41-08:00","title":"Digital China and Social Media","rrule":null,"venue_id":202391675,"url":"http://www.nwchinacouncil.org/node/88","duplicate_of_id":null,"id":1250458430,"version":null,"description":"NW China Council and University of Oregon Center for Asian & Pacific Studies are organizing a group viewing (3:30pm-5pm) of the livestream of a panel discussion at the Paley Center for Media in New York, followed (5pm - 6pm) by a local panel discussion.\n\nPer summary on ReadWriteWeb:\n\"The central question of the event is: What is the relevance of new social networking technologies in our culture and society; and how can we use these tools for digital activism in order to foster positive social change, particularly in China?\"\n\nAfter watching livestream of the panel from the Paley Center for Media, the Portland panel will lead a Q&A.\n\nThe New York panel is:\n- Ai Weiwei, leading contemporary Chinese artist and digital evangelist\n- Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter\n- Richard McManus, founder of ReadWriteWeb\n- Orville Schell (moderator), Arthur Ross Director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society\n\nThe Portland panel is:\n- Prof. Jeffrey Barlow, Director of Pacific University Berglund Center for Internet Studies\n- Craig Fisk, President, Picocosmos\n- Prof. David Li, University of Oregon Center for Asian and Pacific Studies\n\n$5 (free for NW China Council members and University of Oregon ID holders).","venue":{"updated_at":"2009-08-31T10:24:10-07:00","postal_code":null,"latitude":45.5239,"title":"University of Oregon White Stag Blocks","region":"Oregon","url":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"country":"United States","id":202391675,"version":1,"street_address":"70 NW Couch","description":null,"locality":"Portland","telephone":null,"longitude":-122.671,"source_id":996333775,"address":null,"email":null,"created_at":"2009-08-31T10:24:10-07:00"},"source_id":996334173,"start_time":"2010-03-15T15:30:00-07:00","end_time":"2010-03-15T18:30:00-07:00","created_at":"2010-03-10T21:19:41-08:00"},{"updated_at":"2010-03-11T14:53:47-08:00","title":"pdxruby: Ruby fixtures alternatives exploration and dinner","rrule":null,"venue_id":202391950,"url":"http://pdxruby.org/","duplicate_of_id":null,"id":1250458440,"version":null,"description":"Join a few Ruby programmers for dinner to explore alternatives to fixtures for use in tests. \n\nWe'd like to co-present our findings at the next pdxruby meeting.\n\nLibraries we'd like to explore include factory_girl, machinist, and others: http://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/rails_fixture_replacement.html\n\nWe can use existing open source Ruby software to experiment with, by making a branch, trying out the library, and requesting a merge if we like the changes.

As a \"Geekdad\" with a daughter, I found this unacceptable, and decided to do something about it... I went back to school... elementary school that is, to teach programming to the kids. My goal was to find an environment and a style that would encourage girls with curiosity to enjoy being controlling computers in creative ways, and in the process, encourage and involve every kid.\n\nMy talk discusses the journey of coming up with a girl-friendly curriculum for teaching programming that boys wouldn't notice anything different. I then show off some of the new crop of \"Integrated Learning Environments\", i.e. Alice, E-Toys and Scratch. I finally give an overview of my \"Computer Club\" and how others can use what I've done to teach others.\n\n----------\n\nSpeaker: Howard Abrams\n\nMy first job in high school was teaching Basic and Logo programming to 8 year old kids; however, I haven't taught since graduating from college. After programming for 25 years (and Java for 12), I'm now intrigue about returning to my roots and working with the next generation.\n\n----------\n\nPJUG meetings start with some time to eat and socialize (pizza and beverages are provided), followed by the featured speaker, then Q&A, discussion, sometimes a drawing to give away swag. :)\n\nThough we like knowing how many people to expect, you don't *have* to RSVP, on Upcoming or otherwise.

Electricity advances developmental factors such as small business development, extended working hours, access to communications, enhanced education levels and rural development. Energy can improve life of millions. \n\n\nIn developing countries access to energy remains constrained by factors such as limited access to well adapted affordable technology, fragmented small markets, prohibitive taxes and limited financial resources.  On Dec 14th , at the Copenhagen Climate conference the Obama Administration announced a $350 million dollar initiative dubbed \u201cClimate REDI\u201d to promote clean energy technologies in developing countries.   \n\n\nJoin us on March 17th for a discussion with our expert panel, on what kind of innovations in products, finance, supply and service can ensure reliable & affordable energy to the billions of poor across the world.   \n\n\nOur 2 presenters Michael(Kipp) Baratoff, Principal, Equilibrium Capital  & Patrick Maloney, Program Director, Lemelson Foundation have been fully immersed in this space, having been engaged with social entrepreneurs over the course of their careers. Lemelson Foundation awarded an energy grant to Selco India for it\u2019s Incubation Center and Innovation Department to develop new products and new business models to solve key problems for energy consumers.

Pizza at 6:30, meeting at 7.\n\nTalk: \"Exploratory Testing: Now In Session\"\n \nThe agile nature of exploration and the ability of testers to rapidly apply their skills and experience make exploratory testing a widely used test approach\u2014especially when time is short. But exploratory testing is often dismissed by project managers who assume that it is not reproducible, measurable, or accountable. If you share these concerns, a solution may lie in a technique called Session-Based Test Management (SBTM), developed by Jon and his brother James specifically to address these problems. In SBTM, testers are assigned areas of a product to explore, and testing is time boxed in \"sessions\" which have mission statements called \u201ccharters\u201d to create a meaningful and countable unit of work. Jon discusses\u2014and you can practice\u2014the skills of exploration and demonstrates a freely available, open source tool to help manage your exploratoration.\n\nSpeaker Bio: Jon Bach has been in testing for 14 years, 12 of which has been as a manager.  His experience includes managing teams at Microsoft, HP and LexisNexis, and is currently a managing consultant for Quardev, Inc. -- a Seattle test lab.  He speaks frequently about test management and exploratory testing, and is the co-inventor (with his brother James) of Session-Based Test Management.  He\u2019s also written a few articles for testing magazines as well as a listed co-author of a Microsoft Patterns and Practices book on acceptance testing (available for free online).  Find him on Facebook, Twitter, or his presentations and articles on http://www.quardev.com, where he also has a blog.","venue":{"updated_at":"2010-03-02T09:18:43-08:00","postal_code":"97201","latitude":45.50923,"title":"Portland State University Engineering Building (FAB) Rm 86-01","region":"Oregon","url":"http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=45.50926,-122.681818&spn=0,359.997811&z=19&layer=c&cbll=45.509201,-122.681607&panoid=Al5E19EOZ5oQ3dB_Qq2t9A&cbp=12,89.86,,2,-0.43","duplicate_of_id":null,"country":null,"id":202391953,"version":null,"street_address":"SW 4th and College Avenue","description":"On 4th street at College (east side of the street)\r\nRoom FAB 86-01 is in the basement\r\nTake elevator or stairs down to basement and follow signs","locality":"Portland","telephone":"","longitude":-122.681209,"source_id":null,"address":"","email":"","created_at":"2010-03-02T00:00:40-08:00"},"source_id":null,"start_time":"2010-03-17T18:30:00-07:00","end_time":"2010-03-17T21:00:00-07:00","created_at":"2010-02-28T18:38:46-08:00"},{"updated_at":"2010-03-15T10:34:10-07:00","title":"PLUG Advanced Topics: What Went Wrong with My Disaster Recovery Plan","rrule":null,"venue_id":202391197,"url":"http://pdxlinux.org","duplicate_of_id":null,"id":1250458446,"version":null,"description":"Brian Martin will be test-driving his IEEE presentation on his experiences in a true, \"abandon the building\" disaster recovery effort.

Traditionally, it has been difficult for programmers to take advantage of the multi-core systems with their ever-multiplying number of cores. But that is all about to change with JSR-166y. Targeted for Java 7, scheduled for release in late 2010, JSR-166y adds a lightweight task framework known as ForkJoin (FJ) to the Java platform.\n\nSteve Dohrmann will be discussing the fundamentals of parallel Java programming. His talk will include the use of Java threads, an overview of the JSR-166y (ForkJoin) package, and some points on higher-level parallel programming models. If you're a Java developer, you can't afford to miss this opportunity to learn about the future of Java in a parallel world. And developers on other environments will find the overview of parallel application development and solid parallel algorithm fundamentals to be valuable in building systems that scale and provide competitive differentiation for your solutions.\n\nMeet the Speaker: Steve Dohrmann, Software Engineer, Intel\nSince joining Intel in 1994, Steve has worked in a variety of research, advanced development, and product groups within the company.

People are concerned about the diversity of their work force, stock portfolios, student body, and forest insects, just to name a few.  In this talk, I will discuss a work-in-progress visualization technique specifically designed to communicate diversity information.  I will present the design concerns, resulting visualizations, and a study design for evaluating the method.  I will conclude with a discussion of a case-study application to moth species data.\n\nBio: Ronald Metoyer is an Associate Professor in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Oregon State University.  He earned a Ph.D. from the Georgia Institute of Technology where he worked in the Graphics, Visualization and Usability Center with a focus on modeling and visualizing the motion of pedestrians in urban and architectural scenes.  Dr. Metoyer currently co-directs the NVIDIA Graphics and Imaging Technologies Lab (GAIT) with his colleagues at OSU. His past research efforts have involved the investigation of techniques for manipulating motion capture data and for facilitating the creation of 3D content by end users with the goal of empowering domain experts to create compelling and interactive content for their domain specific needs.  In 2002, he received an NSF CAREER Award for his work in \u201cUnderstanding the Complexities of Animated Content\u201d.  Dr. Metoyer\u2019s most recent research interests fall under the domain of information visualization.\n\n------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Scientific Data Visualization in a GPU World\n\nDetails:\n\n    * Presenter: Prof. Mike Bailey\n    * Date: Wednesday, March 24, 2010\n    * Time: 11:00am\n\nAbstract: One of the fun aspects of scientific data visualization is that there are no rules \u2014 anything that adds insight to the data display is fair game.  Add that to the fun of custom-programming the GPU, and you\u2019ve really got something!\n\nThis talk will discuss some of the uses of custom GPU programming to create better and more interactive visualization displays.  We will look at techniques in the realm of scalar visualization, vector visualization, volume visualization, and terrain mapping.\n\nBio: Mike Bailey is a Professor in Computer Science at Oregon State University. He specializes in scientific visualization, 3D interactive computer graphics, GPU programming, stereographics, and computer aided geometric design.","venue":{"updated_at":"2008-07-11T16:12:44-07:00","postal_code":"97204","latitude":45.520379,"title":"Galois, Inc","region":"OR","url":"","duplicate_of_id":null,"country":"US","id":202390439,"version":null,"street_address":"421 SW 6th Ave. Suite 300","description":"3rd floor of the Commonwealth Building","locality":"Portland","telephone":"","longitude":-122.677897,"source_id":null,"address":"","email":"","created_at":"2008-07-11T16:12:04-07:00"},"source_id":null,"start_time":"2010-03-24T10:30:00-07:00","end_time":"2010-03-24T11:30:00-07:00","created_at":"2010-03-20T16:43:21-07:00"},{"updated_at":"2010-01-10T14:35:39-08:00","title":"IDSA 3by10","rrule":null,"venue_id":202391891,"url":"http://idsaor.org/idsa_events.html","duplicate_of_id":null,"id":1250458151,"version":null,"description":"IDSA Oregon presents: 3BY10 - A chance to see what creative professionals and design students in Portland are up to, ten minutes at a time.

Hosted by the Rose City Software Process Improvement Network (SPIN).\n\n\n<h3>Abstract</h3>\nMany of you may have heard about \"wicked problems\".  For example, in many cases one can define the problem, then pursue a solution; but with wicked problems, one can't define the problem well until they finally have the solution.  Wicked problems have several other interesting characteristics as well.  An approach of \"taming wicked problems\" contradicts the wisdom of trying to make the nature and complexity of the solution fit the nature and\ncomplexity of the problem.\n\nThe concept of wicked problems can be used as a paradigm for understanding many real world situations, including many in software development, managing teams and leading projects, organizational change, strategic planning, and more.  In this presentation, you'll hear about 7 principles that can be applied for dealing with wicked problems.  We'll look at several examples of problems, some more wicked than others, and how to analyze and deal with them.  We'll also look at several seminal ideas in software engineering and see how the principles were used.  Finally, we'll gather some problems from the audience and practice characterizing the problems and applying the principles for planning how to cope with them.\n\n\n<h3>Speaker Bio</h3>\nBill Gilmore has worked in software engineering for over 20 years in various development, management, process and consulting roles.

At the same time, only a very few experimental works have been conducted to study the properties of on-die interconnects constituting these networks. \nIn this talk, results obtained within the framework of our experimental study on global interconnects, constructed as transmission lines, that carry out on-die global signaling and on interconnects constituting power supply and ground grids, are presented. In the study we employed VLSI engineering samples typical for 90 nm and 45 nm CMOS technology nodes. \nWe found that local voltage fluctuations in power supply and ground grids, excited by on-die logic cell switching have a resonant-like form. This finding resolves the discussed in literature controversy over the need for considering parasitic inductance i.e., the on-die power grids should be described as an RLC circuit. \nWe experimentally observed and confirmed by modeling that the active element (i.e., CMOS logic cell) influences the frequency properties of power supply and ground grids during its switching (as opposed to before or after switching). Thus, it was shown that frequency properties of both grids are inter-related via the interconnecting active elements. \nIn our experimental study was found that the impedance matching between CMOS driver and a driven transmission line, and the Ohmic losses of on-die transmission lines, implemented by standard metal layers of modern technology nodes, play an important role in circuits\u2019 performance. The study suggests that impedance mismatch results in excessive power consumption and signal integrity problems. The high Ohmic losses result in a significant distortion and Inter-Symbol Interference of already a few hundreds Mega-Hertz signals. \nOur study reveals that relatively low but repetitive voltage oscillations on on-die power supply and ground grids, excited by logic cells switching, may lead not only to logic faults, as it has been regarded, but also to an accumulated damage of VLSI MOSFETs. Thus, according to Berkley Reliability Tools models simulations they accelerate the device degradation due to three main wearout mechanisms, such as Time-Dependent Dielectric Breakdown, Negative Bias Temperature Instability and Hot Carrier Injection. The similar device damage, as the study shows, is caused by the impedance mismatch induced distortions of signals supplied to input of on-die CMOS logic cells.\n\n\nSpeaker(s): Pavel Livshits, \n\nAgenda: \nWednesday, March 31, 2010, 5:30 \u2013 7:00pm\n\n\nLocation: \nRoom: 124\nBldg: Shiley Hall\nUniversity of Portland\n5000 N.

Typical refactorings, such as function extraction and generalisation, are intended to make a program more amenable to extension, more comprehensible and so on. Refactorings differ from other sorts of program transformation in being applied to source code (rather than within the bowels of a compiler), and in having an effect across a code base. Because of this, there is a need to give (semi-)automated support to the process.  This talk will reflect on our experience of building tools to refactor functional programs written in Haskell (HaRe?)  and Erlang (Wrangler). In doing this we will address system design, the pragmatics of system take-up, as well as contrasting the style of refactoring and tooling for Haskell and Erlang.\n\nBio: Simon Thompson is a Professor of Logic and Computation at the University of Kent.","venue":{"updated_at":"2008-07-11T16:12:44-07:00","postal_code":"97204","latitude":45.520379,"title":"Galois, Inc","region":"OR","url":"","duplicate_of_id":null,"country":"US","id":202390439,"version":null,"street_address":"421 SW 6th Ave. Suite 300","description":"3rd floor of the Commonwealth Building","locality":"Portland","telephone":"","longitude":-122.677897,"source_id":null,"address":"","email":"","created_at":"2008-07-11T16:12:04-07:00"},"source_id":null,"start_time":"2010-04-01T10:30:00-07:00","end_time":"2010-04-01T11:30:00-07:00","created_at":"2010-03-20T16:44:21-07:00"},{"updated_at":"2010-03-19T22:21:36-07:00","title":"Portland Ten Skill Development Workshop: Accounting with Perkins and Company","rrule":null,"venue_id":202391600,"url":"http://www.portlandten.com/skills","duplicate_of_id":null,"id":1250458460,"version":null,"description":"ADDITIONAL EVENT INFO\nSchedule & Topics\n\nWorkshops are held January 28- April 16,2010, on Tuesdays 2-4 pm and Thursdays 6-8 pm at NedSpace Old Town\u2013 for a full schedule of workshops & topics: http://www.portlandten.com/skills\n\nPricing\n\nPasses can be purchased at the door-- cash or check at the door only, please.

Tech America will be a supporting organization for the forums\n\nOregon\u2019s economy is facing great challenges. The state is struggling with serious budgetary shortfalls and that is exacerbated by an unemployment rate that is hovering above 10 percent. With the recent passage of measures 66 & 67 many Oregonians question what the impact will be for Oregon businesses. Policies that support and encourage business growth and economic development are a top-of-mind priority for many Oregonians. These candidate forums are intended to provide an opportunity for members of the business community to ask the candidates from each party what they would do to help support business and economic growth in Oregon.\n\nThe Democratic Gubernatorial Candidate forum will take place on Wednesday, April 7 at Portland General Electric\u2019s auditorium located at 121 SW Salmon St, 2WTC in Portland. It will feature Democratic candidates Bill Bradbury (www.bradburyfororegon.com) and John Kitzhaber, (www.johnkitzhaber.com).\n\nThe Republican Gubernatorial Candidate forum will take place on Tuesday, April 27 at the Multnomah Athletic Club 1849 SW Salmon St. in Portland. It will feature Republican candidates Allen Alley (www.allenalley.com) and Chris Dudley (www.chrisdudley.com).\n\nTickets are required for onsite attendees and individual live stream access. Registration is recommended for satellite venues.\n\nThe gubernatorial candidate forum will be held prior to the primaries and will be moderated by Laural Porter of KGW News (twitter.com/lauralkgw). Check-in begins at 4:00PM. The program will begin at 4:30 PM and will run to 6:00 PM. Tickets are $20 for members of presenting or supporting organizations and $40 for non-members. We encourage attendees to pre-register online using the link below.\n\nThe forums will be streamed live over the web. Individual web stream tickets can be purchased for $10 in advance, but business community members outside of the Portland area may attend a satellite event in their local area at no charge.\n\nFor more information about the forums, or to register for either of these events, please go to:\n\nDemocratic Candidates Forum: www.sao.org/event/dgp\n\nRepublican Candidates Forum: www.sao.org/event/rgp\n\nFollow the discussions on twitter: #pdxGDP & #pdxRGP.

We have developed a plan (PDF) for doing this, and need to start development.\n\n* Hacker lounge planning: We have a 24-hour on-site \u201chacker lounge\u201d this year for attendees to collaborate and hang out at. We need to discuss how to organize events in this room to provide just enough structure to help attendees without stifling their creativity.\n\n* Logistics, venue and activity planning: We\u2019re using the beautiful Portland Art Museum Mark Building as our venue this year. Discuss how to make the best use of this space and incorporate fun activities ranging from mobile donut trucks to on-site massages with our logistics crew.\n\n* Or whatever you think would be helpful.\n\nThanks and see you at the sprint!","venue":{"updated_at":"2010-02-25T11:34:03-08:00","postal_code":"97201","latitude":45.514493,"title":"Market Street Pub","region":"OR","url":"","duplicate_of_id":null,"country":"US","id":202391950,"version":null,"street_address":"1526 S.W. 10th","description":"","locality":"Portland","telephone":"","longitude":-122.6850806,"source_id":null,"address":"1526 S.W. 10th, Portland OR","email":"","created_at":"2010-02-25T11:32:14-08:00"},"source_id":null,"start_time":"2010-04-10T11:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2010-04-10T17:00:00-07:00","created_at":"2010-04-08T04:07:16-07:00"},{"updated_at":"2010-01-29T14:13:21-08:00","title":"Cocktail Camp","rrule":null,"venue_id":202390445,"url":"http://www.cocktailcamp.net/","duplicate_of_id":null,"id":1250458252,"version":null,"description":"CocktailCamp is an informal day-long gathering for people who enjoy making, drinking, and discussing cocktails.

She focused instinctively on user flow, interaction, and attractive solutions. Corrina is currently a UX Designer on the Microsoft Developer Division team. To broaden her impact, Corrina pursued a software engineering degree to combine with her passion for user experience design. For Corrina, user experience is what matters. A product that doesn\u2019t solve a problem, is difficult to use, and doesn\u2019t draw the user in, regardless of how amazing the technology, will fail.\n\nTOPIC: Creating Great UX with Expression Blend\nCorrina will do an intro to Blend and walkthrough the process of creating a great user experience; this will involve SketchFlow because detailing and iterating on user flow, layout, and animations and transitions prior to full-scale implementation is key to great UX design and this is done in tools like SketchFlow. She will also likely walkthrough the process of building a simple application in Blend to show the core functionality of Blend (maybe create a phone application).\n\nWarmup - The Reactive Framework (Rx) in Silverlight\nAt the beginning of the meeting (6pm) our own Eric Sterling of Vertigo will be giving a short introduction to Rx. Have you had trouble writing asynchronous code (including unit testing code)? If so, Rx offers a compelling and syntactically attractive way of handling events.","venue":{"updated_at":"2008-09-14T20:51:17-07:00","postal_code":"97204","latitude":45.518088,"title":"Webtrends","region":"OR","url":"http://www.webtrends.com/","duplicate_of_id":null,"country":"US","id":202390594,"version":null,"street_address":"851 SW 6th Ave.","description":"","locality":"Portland","telephone":"877-932-8736","longitude":-122.679722,"source_id":null,"address":"","email":"","created_at":"2008-09-14T20:49:19-07:00"},"source_id":null,"start_time":"2010-04-13T18:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2010-04-13T21:00:00-07:00","created_at":"2010-04-05T13:57:20-07:00"},{"updated_at":"2010-04-12T18:16:55-07:00","title":"Portland Python User Group April Meetup","rrule":null,"venue_id":202390594,"url":"http://pdxpython.org/","duplicate_of_id":null,"id":1250458499,"version":null,"description":"Pythonistas,\n\nIt's that time again- time for the Portland Python User Group meeting!

Our focus is to help practitioners or potential practitioners of social projects push beyond discussion and debate into action. Each Forum will inspire and teach with ideas, powerful role models, and stories. Speakers, content experts, panels, and workshops will help you improve your strategies for planning and launching effective social ventures. The Forum will create a context to connect, learn, and take action around ideas that lead to tangible change\u2014all in a venue designed for building community. The Forum is intended to attract people with a wide range of experience and backgrounds, but with a common interest\u2014making a difference. If you are getting tired of waiting for someone else to step up to take on issues you care about, come see how this can be a place to make a difference, here or around the world. We invite people from both the business and non-profit community\u2014investors and activists\u2014to join in, work together, and make this a model for other cities to adopt.

Such Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) applications have promise to feed energy back to the grid for special purposes to benefit both the utility and the electric car owner. \n- Significant utility-scale storage capacity solves an even bigger issue, capturing and utilizing the massive amounts of electrical generating capacity that is otherwise typically unused.\n\nThe discussion will focus on: \n- Value chain elements of the energy storage industry \n- Who are local champions of energy storage \n- What are the interests of the investment community \n- What does the policy and regulatory framework look like \n- How do customers value energy storage\n- How is the smart grid expected to interact with energy storage  \n\nJoin our panel on April 21st, to understand the technologies, trade-offs, market segments, future potential of energy storage.  \n\nOur 3 panelists are: \n- Dylan Steeg, Director Intel Capital, Intel's global venture capital organization.

OSCON is the place to be inspired and challenged, renew bonds to community, make new connections, and find ways to give back to the open source movement. OSCON has also become one of the most important places to make open source related announcements, and to unveil projects and products.\n\nOpen source is a fundamental principle at the core of many established and emerging technologies, driving the future of the computer industry. OSCON explores the open source technologies that are here to stay, what will broaden the foundation, and what will lead the way to unexpected places and innovations.\n\n\"For those who have not been to OSCON, it's a great technical conference covering the whole spectrum of open source, including Linux, MySQL, the LAMP stack, Perl, Python, Ruby on Rails, middleware, applications, cloud computing, and more. OSCON always has great keynotes, tutorials, and evening Birds-of-a-Feather sessions.

A cyborg (shorthand for \u201ccybernetic organism\u201d) is a symbiotic fusion of human and machine.

Classrooms, individuals and businesses are encouraged to attend the event remotely. It will be livestreamed through multiple channels and will be archived and tagged for future viewing. Details on remote conference access will be available a week before the conference begins. \n\nCyborgCamp is open to sponsors. We're interested in cutting edge companies or non-profits who are interested in education/technological development. Please E-mail caseorganic@gmail.com if you or your organization/business is interested in this.
